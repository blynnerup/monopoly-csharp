# Monopoly C Sharp implmentation

<p> Redoing the Monopoly implementation from first year of university, just to see if I got better and faster. Will try and track time used, except the manual task of writing the in game text. Hopefully can be reused for another implementation.</p>

## Time spent
<p>Total time spent: d00:h00:m53:s12</p>

### Game State
Basic classes being created. Still unplayable. Prints some text in console when started.
